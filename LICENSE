JUST DON'T DO ANYTHING

Treat it as read only. These are all the things you can do with the repository:

- View this repository on GitHub
- Star this repository
- Not do anything that is prohibited

The following actions are prohibited, and include, but are not limited to:

- Cloning this repository
- Forking this repository
- Running an instance of this bot
- Asking if you can use this source code in your projects because you will get no for an answer

Just stick to what's explicitly allowed and we're fine
