# Commands
Commands are sorted into **cogs**, which are essentially groups of commands. The discord.py library uses cogs as a way of organising similar commands together so that the final file won't be a billion lines long.

Each command can be invoked using its name or aliases, which will be listed below. Some commands have convenient aliases that will save you some time.

## Documentation Syntax
To simplify things, I've made a chart that tells you what exactly the argument syntax means

|Representation in Documentation|Meaning|
|:---:|---|
|`?`|Bot's static global prefix|
|`command_name`|The command's name. Most of the time, the `command_name` provided will be what is written into the code as the method's name. The `command_name` will always be postfixed to the prefix|
|`arg`|An arbitrary argument of any datatype. The datatype will be specified if the `arg` requires data to be in a specific datatype|
|`[arg]`|The `arg` is necessary for command to function properly. You must provide whatever argument that is listed or else the command cannot be called|
|`(arg)`|The `arg` is optional, and will still allow the command to function without it|
|`dt`|A human readable date in a human readable format that will be parsed to extract a timestamp. When passing a `dt`, you pass it along with the argument it is attached to|
|`[dt]`|The `dt` is required as a part of the `arg`, whether or not the `arg` is optional|
|`(dt)`|The `dt` is an optional part of the `arg`, and will still allow the command to function without it|
|`*va`|Variable amount of consecutive `arg` can be passed, but at least one must be passed|
|`-arg_reliant`|Specifies that the current `arg` cannot be passed if the argument `arg_reliant` is not passed|

## <a name="moderation"></a> Moderation

### <a name="chatclean"></a> Chatclean
##### Usage
> `?chatclean (amount) (@mention)-amount`

##### Permissions
|User|Bot|
|:---:|:---:|
|`Manage Messages`|`Manage Messages`|

##### Special Cases
- `amount` defaults to 1
    - This argument represents the number of messages to be processed. There will be some cases where this does not equal the number of deleted messages
    - The bot is not allowed to delete messages older than 2 weeks. This is a built in Discord API restriction
- If `@mention` is specified, it will delete messages only from that user

### Mute
##### Usage
> `?mute [@mention]*va (reason)(dt)`

##### Permissions
|User|Bot|
|:---:|:---:|
|`Manage Roles`|`Manage Roles`|

##### Special Cases
- You cannot mute an already muted person
    - *This is determined by if the user has the "Muted" role, which is automatically generated by the bot*
- `reason` defaults to "Unspecified" if not explicitly provided

##### Aliases
`clear` `clean` `chatclear` `cleanchat` `clearchat` `purge`
